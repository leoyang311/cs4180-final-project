Step-by-Step Guide to Achieve Modified TD3 for Car Racing

---

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Car Racing is available in OpenAI Gym as `CarRacing-v1`. Start by installing required libraries and setting up the environment.

Code:
```bash
pip install stable-baselines3[extra] gym
```

```python
import gym
from stable_baselines3 import TD3
from stable_baselines3.common.noise import NormalActionNoise, OrnsteinUhlenbeckActionNoise
import numpy as np
```

Pseudocode:
1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Create the `CarRacing-v1` environment.

Code:
```python
# Create the Car Racing environment
env = gym.make("CarRacing-v1")
```

---

### Step 2: Preprocess the Environment
Enhance the observations (e.g., images) to make them suitable for training. Normalize the inputs and preprocess raw images if necessary.

Code Revision:
```python
# Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
env = gym.wrappers.TransformObservation(env, lambda obs: obs / 255.0)
```

---

### Step 3: Define Exploration Noise
To encourage exploration, define an action noise mechanism (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise or Gaussian noise).

Pseudocode:
1. Initialize the action space.
2. Define the noise mechanism.

Code:
```python
# Define exploration noise
n_actions = env.action_space.shape[-1]
action_noise = Ornstein-UhlenbeckActionNoise(mean=np.zeros(n_actions), sigma=0.1 * np.ones(n_actions))
```

---

### Step 4: Customize the Reward Function
Modify the reward function to incentivize speed, track alignment, and penalize undesired behavior.

Pseudocode:
1. Override the `step` function to calculate a custom reward.
2. Extract speed, track alignment, and penalties from the environment observations.

Code:
```python
class CustomCarRacingEnv(gym.Wrapper):
    def __init__(self, env):
        super(CustomCarRacingEnv, self).__init__(env)

    def step(self, action):
        obs, reward, done, info = self.env.step(action)
        speed = obs[2]  # Example: Extract speed from observation (adjust index as needed)
        track_alignment = 1 - abs(obs[0])  # Example: Penalize deviation from center track
        brake_penalty = -abs(action[2]) if action[2] < 0 else 0  # Penalize braking

        # Custom reward
        reward += 0.1 * speed + 0.5 * track_alignment + brake_penalty
        return obs, reward, done, info

# Wrap the environment with the custom reward
env = CustomCarRacingEnv(env)
```

---

### Step 5: Initialize TD3 Model
Use the `TD3` algorithm from `stable-baselines3` and configure the hyperparameters.

Pseudocode:
1. Set learning rates and other hyperparameters.
2. Use the CNN policy to process image observations.
3. Specify the noise mechanism for exploration.

Code:
```python
# Create TD3 model
model = TD3(
    "CnnPolicy",             # Use CNN to process image-based observations
    env,
    action_noise=action_noise,
    learning_rate=1e-4,      # Learning rate for stable training
    buffer_size=100000,      # Replay buffer size
    batch_size=64,           # Batch size for updates
    train_freq=(1, "step"),  # Train after every step
    gamma=0.99,              # Discount factor
    tau=0.005,               # Target network soft update rate
    verbose=1,               # Print training progress
    tensorboard_log="./td3_car_racing_logs/"
)
```

---

### Step 6: Train the Model
Train the model using `model.learn` and monitor progress.

Pseudocode:
1. Train the model for a specified number of timesteps.
2. Save the model periodically.

Code:
```python
# Train the model
model.learn(total_timesteps=100000)

# Save the model
model.save("td3_car_racing")
```

---

### Step 7: Test the Model
Evaluate the trained model by loading it and running it in the environment.

Pseudocode:
1. Load the trained model.
2. Reset the environment and test the policy.
3. Render the environment to visualize performance.

Code:
```python
# Load the trained model
model = TD3.load("td3_car_racing", env=env)

# Test the model
obs = env.reset()
for _ in range(1000):
    action, _ = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    env.render()
    if done:
        obs = env.reset()

env.close()
```

---

### Step 8: Fine-Tune Hyperparameters
Iteratively refine the following:
1. **Learning Rate**: Adjust between \( 1e{-4} \) and \( 1e{-3} \).
2. **Reward Weights**: Tune \( lpha \), \( eta \), \( \gamma \), and \( \delta \) for speed, alignment, off-track penalties, and brake penalties.
3. **Noise Parameters**: Adjust \( \sigma \) and explore Gaussian vs Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise.

Code Example:
```python
# Example: Adjust hyperparameters
model = TD3(
    "CnnPolicy",
    env,
    action_noise=NormalActionNoise(mean=np.zeros(n_actions), sigma=0.2 * np.ones(n_actions)),
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    batch_size=128,
)
```

---

### Summary of Steps
1. **Set Up the Environment**: Create and preprocess `CarRacing-v1`.
2. **Define Exploration Noise**: Use Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or Gaussian noise.
3. **Customize Reward Function**: Encourage speed and track alignment, penalize braking and off-track behavior.
4. **Initialize TD3 Model**: Use CNN policy and configure hyperparameters.
5. **Train the Model**: Learn from the environment and save periodically.
6. **Test the Model**: Load and evaluate the trained model.
7. **Fine-Tune**: Iteratively optimize hyperparameters for better performance.

This structure ensures you can efficiently implement and improve the TD3 algorithm for Car Racing.
